# Architecture

## Core data model

The product is a recursive **pivot tree**, not a flat table (see [`lib/types.ts`](../lib/types.ts)):

```ts
PivotNode {
  lines: string[]         // the fields at one indent level, e.g.
                          //   ["Item Qty: 16", "UID: AVASCASC"] (>=1, stacked)
  children: PivotNode[]   // leaf = []
}
```

The parser produces a raw **Grid** (`Cell[][]`); `rowsToPivotTree` turns it into a `PivotNode` tree of arbitrary depth. The pivot structure is an ordered list of **indent buckets** — each bucket is one indent level holding one or more fields. A node's `lines` are that level's fields stacked at the same indent; rows whose values match across all of a level's fields merge into one node (composite group key). Only the optional title is a heading — everything else is styled body text.

Multiple pasted tables are held as a `TableState[]` in `components/PasteInput.tsx`; each `TableState` carries its own grid, `pivotLevels` (`number[][]` — the ordered indent buckets), `markers`, and `sectionTitle`. `components/tableModel.ts` `tableToHtml(t)` runs the per-table nest→render pipeline and is the single source used by both the card preview and the combined export.

## The pivot view (how a Grid becomes a tree) — `rowsToPivotTree`

Row 0 is field names. You arrange fields into an **ordered list of indent buckets** (`pivotLevels: number[][]`): bucket 1 is the outermost level, within each group nest by bucket 2, and so on. A bucket can hold **one or more** fields — fields stacked in one bucket render at the same indentation and form a **composite group key**, so rows merge into one node only when they match across every field in that bucket. Each line is labelled `Field name: value` (the field name comes from that column's header). A per-level **Markers** picker chooses each level's bullet/number style (`1.`/`1)`/`A.`/`a.`/`I.`/`i.`/`•`/`–`/None; default = the `1./a./i.` cycle); only the first field of a multi-field level is marked. Blank cell → `(blank)`; first-seen order preserved at every level.

```
1. Item Category: Fruit
   a. Item Name: Apple
        i. Item Qty: 16             ← bucket 3 holds three fields,
           UID: AVASCASC               stacked at one indent
           Item Description: Lorem…
   b. Item Name: Banana
        …
2. Item Category: Meat
   …
```

Output is a `PivotNode[]` (arbitrary depth; each node carries its level's `lines`). The optional **Section title** renders as `<p class="ws-title">` and the nested rows as `<p class="ws-lvl" data-level="N">` (depth clamped at 9). `buildWordHtml` maps these to the destination document's **Word styles** (title → the Heading style, body → the Body style) when style names are set, so a Use-Destination-Styles paste adopts the template's look; otherwise they use the app's direct per-level styling. With a title the nested data starts at level 2; without one, level 1. The Structure picker builds the buckets: an Add-fields pool plus ◄ outdent / ► indent / ▲ ▼ reorder / ✕ remove per placed field.

## Data flow

```
clipboard (text/html, else text/plain)
  -> SheetJS XLSX.read({ type: "string" })
  -> sheet_to_json({ header: 1, blankrows: false, defval: "", raw: false })   -> raw Grid  (append a TableState)
  -> tableToHtml(t):
       rowsToPivotTree(grid, pivotLevels)
         -> renderPivotTree(tree, title?, markers)                           -> HTML fragment
  -> live preview (RenderedPreview, dangerouslySetInnerHTML; scoped [data-level] CSS)
  -> buildWordHtml + htmlToPlainText -> navigator.clipboard.write             -> paste into Word
```

Per-table **Copy for Word** runs `tableToHtml` for that one table; combined **Copy all** joins every table's fragment and runs **one** `buildWordHtml` (valid because its rewrites are global regexes and it emits a single `@page`). `renderPivotTree` escapes all user-derived text (`& < >`). The JSON view shows the raw Grid instead of the rendered tree.

## Clipboard output

`lib/clipboard.ts` wraps the rendered fragment for Word and applies the styling:
- `buildWordHtml(fragment, heading, bodyFont)` → an Office-namespaced `<html>` with a `<style>` (`@page`, body font, the rules below) and `<body>{rewritten fragment}`. It rewrites `ws-title` → `MsoTitle` and nested `<p data-level="N">` → `MsoPiv1..9`. **When a style name is set** (`headingStyleName` for the title, `bodyStyleName` for the body), that class carries `mso-style-name:"<name>"` (title also `mso-outline-level:1`) + indent + single line-height and **no direct font/color**, so the destination document's style wins on a Use-Destination-Styles paste. **When blank**, the class carries the app's direct per-level look (`heading.levels[N-1]`) + indent + single spacing. The browser writes the Windows CF_HTML header automatically.
- `htmlToPlainText(fragment)` → readable plain-text fallback for the `text/plain` flavor.

`HeadingStyle = { levels: LevelStyle[]; indentStep: number; headingStyleName: string; bodyStyleName: string }` is the single styling source, built once in `PasteInput` and shared by every table — the two `*StyleName` fields are the Word style names (defaults `Heading 1` / `paratext`; blank = the app's direct per-level look, Arial 11 black), `levels` is the direct per-level look used when unmapped, and `indentStep` (inches) is the left-indent per nesting level. The card's `copyForWord()` and the parent's `copyAll()` write a `ClipboardItem` with both flavors via `navigator.clipboard.write`. Export is clipboard-only (no download).

## Out of scope

- **`.docx` generation** — export is HTML-on-clipboard only.
